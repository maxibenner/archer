				which you may use our online services, website, and software provided on or in connection with the
				service (collectively the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have
				read,
				understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Service Agreement (“Agreement”) and to the

				registered user of our Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access
				the
				Service (“Users”).
			</p>
			<p>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT
				CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN
				INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

			<h2>1. Use of Our Service</h2>
			<p>Fotura provides an online platform for photography education.
			</p>

				Fotura
				Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. If you are a child under 13 years of age,
				we
				may need your parent or guardian’s consent before allowing you to use the Service. Supplemental
				terms
				and conditions may apply to some Services, such as rules for a particular competition, promotion,
				service or other activity, or terms that may accompany certain content accessible through the
				Services.
				Supplemental terms and conditions will be disclosed to you in connection with such competition,
				service
				or activity. Any supplemental terms and conditions are in addition to these terms and, in the event
				of a
				conflict, prevail over these terms. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed
				from
				the Service by Fotura.

			<h3>B. Fotura Service.</h3>
			<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive,

				only

				herein
				in the Service and the Fotura Content (as defined below). Fotura may terminate this license at any
				time
				for any reason or no reason.

			<h3>C. Fotura Accounts.</h3>
			<p>Your Fotura account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and

				provide
				accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your
				account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords
				(passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your
				account. You must notify Fotura immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your
				account. Fotura will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.

				disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or
				non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,”
				“spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request
				messages
				to the Fotura servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a
				conventional on-line web browser (except that Fotura grants the operators of public search engines
				revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from fotura.com for the sole purpose of and
				solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials,
				but
				not caches or archives of such materials); (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other
				unsolicited
				email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher

				person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud,
				hiding
				or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi)
				accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or
				authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access
				to
				the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any
				content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.</p>
			<p>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the
				Service,
				to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or
				temporarily
				terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason,
				including
				if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon
				termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.

			<h2>2. Mobile Software</h2>
			<p>We may make available software to access the Service via a mobile device (“Mobile Software”). To use
				the
				Mobile Software you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Mobile Service. Fotura
				does
				not warrant that the Mobile Software will be compatible with your mobile device. Fotura hereby
				grants
				you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile
				Software for one Fotura account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your
				personal
				use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Mobile Software, except
				to
				the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell,
				sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Mobile Software to any third party or use the
				Mobile
				Software to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of
				the
				Mobile Software; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with
				security-related
				features of the Mobile Software, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content

				Software; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Mobile Software.
				You
				acknowledge that Fotura may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Software, and
				may
				automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Mobile Software that you are using on your
				mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the
				terms
				and conditions of this Agreement will apply to all such upgrades. Any third-party code that may be
				incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license
				EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile
				Software or any copy thereof, and Fotura or its third party partners or suppliers retain all right,
				title, and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer
				any of
				the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is
				void. Fotura reserves all rights not expressly granted under this Agreement. If the Mobile Software
				is
				being acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the following provision applies: the
				Mobile Software will be deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer
				software
				documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, as
				applicable.
				Any use, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of the Service and any
				accompanying
				documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these Terms of Service and is
				prohibited
				except to the extent expressly permitted by these Terms of Service. The Mobile Software originates
				in
				the United States, and is subject to United States export laws and regulations. The Mobile Software
				may
				not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those persons or entities prohibited from
				receiving exports from the United States. In addition, the Mobile Software may be subject to the
				import
				and export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws
				related
				to use of the Mobile Software and the Fotura Service.

			<h2>11. Governing Law and Arbitration</h2>
			<h3>A. Governing Law.</h3>
			<p>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in New York; and (ii) the Service shall
				be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Fotura, either
				specific or general, in jurisdictions other than New York. This Agreement shall be governed by the
				internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws
				principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate
				commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any
				arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal
				Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
				for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal
				jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New York County, New York for any actions
				for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent
				jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a
				our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary
				rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.
			</p>
			<h3>B. Arbitration.</h3>
			<p>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS
				THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM FOTURA. In the unlikely event that Fotura has not been
				able to resolve a dispute it has with you after 60 days, we each agree to resolve any claim,
				dispute, or controversy (excluding any Fotura claims for injunctive or other equitable relief)
				arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms of Service, or the breach or alleged
				breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the Judicial Mediation and
				Arbitration Services (“JAMS”) under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for
				JAMS, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in New York County, New York,
				unless you and Fotura agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing,
				administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the
				arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for
				expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
				in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Fotura
				from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of
				Fotura’s proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND
				NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE
				ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS
				ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE
				PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND FOTURA ARE EACH
				WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, .COLLECTIVE ACTION,
				PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
			</p>

				you, but may be assigned by Fotura without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in
				violation hereof shall be null and void.
			</p>
			<h3>B. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.</h3>
			<p>Fotura may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing
				or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through

			</p>
			<h3>C. Entire Agreement/Severability.</h3>
			<p>This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with
				Fotura in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Fotura
				concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent
				jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
				provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event
				of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration
				agreement shall be unenforceable.
			</p>
			<h3>D. No Waiver.</h3>
			<p>No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term
				or any other term, and Fotura’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall
				not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
			</p>
			<h3>E. Government Use Rights.</h3>
			<p>If the Service is licensed to the United States government or any agency thereof, then the Service
				will be deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software

				applicable. Any use, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of the Service and

				Service and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by these Terms of Service.
